# Hello-World
"This repository is for learning GitHub essentials."
My name is Iman, and I am an Informatics major at IUSE. I enjoy working with R programming, and I am currently learning the basics.
I also have hands-on experience working with Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform, where I implemented RBAC, encryption, and created clusters and pipelines to run Spark jobs and train ML models.
